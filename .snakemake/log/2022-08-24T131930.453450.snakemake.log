Error in rule parse:

    shell:
        
        augur parse             --sequences data/all_seq.fasta             --fields strain name description             --output-sequences results/all_seqP.fasta             --output-metadata results/metadata.tsv
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job parse since they might be corrupted:
results/all_seqP.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
