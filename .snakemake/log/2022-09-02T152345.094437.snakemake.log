Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	refine
	1

rule refine:
    input: results/tree.nwk, results/all_alignment.fasta, results/newmeta.csv
    output: results/new_tree.nwk, results/branches.json
    jobid: 0

Error in rule refine:
    jobid: 0
    output: results/new_tree.nwk, results/branches.json
    shell:
        
        augur refine             --tree results/tree.nwk             --alignment results/all_alignment.fasta             --metadata results/newmeta.csv             --output-tree results/new_tree.nwk             --output-node-data results/branches.json
	    --keep-root
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job refine since they might be corrupted:
results/new_tree.nwk, results/branches.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
